Automated Web Application Penetration Testing ToolA modular, multi-threaded Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to automate the reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning phases of web application penetration testing.⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This tool is for educational purposes and ethical testing only. Usage of this tool for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. The developer assumes no liability and is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program.🚀 Features🔍 Subdomain Enumeration: Multi-threaded DNS and HTTP validation to discover active subdomains.🕷️ Intelligent Crawling: Recursively crawls the target to map URLs, forms, and inputs.💉 Vulnerability Scanning:SQL Injection (SQLi): Detects error-based SQL injection in URL parameters and forms.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Tests for reflected XSS vulnerabilities.Local File Inclusion (LFI): Checks for directory traversal patterns.CSRF: Identifies forms missing Anti-CSRF tokens.🛡️ Security Header Analysis: Checks for missing headers like X-Frame-Options, HSTS, and CSP.📊 Reporting: Generates comprehensive HTML reports and JSON logs.⚡ Performance: Uses concurrent.futures for fast, parallel processing.⚙️ Customizable: Supports custom wordlists for subdomains and payloads.🛠️ InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vuln-scanner.git
cd web-vuln-scanner
Install dependencies:This tool requires Python 3 and a few external libraries.Bashpip install requests beautifulsoup4
📖 UsageBasic ScanPerform a standard crawl and vulnerability scan on a target URL:Bashpython scanner.py -u http://example.com
Enable Subdomain EnumerationScan for vulnerabilities and enumerate subdomains (default 10 threads):Bashpython scanner.py -u http://example.com --scan-subdomains
Full Custom ScanRun a comprehensive scan with custom wordlists and JSON output:Bashpython scanner.py -u http://example.com \
    --scan-subdomains \
    --subdomain-wordlist wordlists/subdomains.txt \
    --sql-wordlist wordlists/sqli.txt \
    --json results.json \
    --verbose
